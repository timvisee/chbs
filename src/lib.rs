//! # Correct Horse Battery Staple
//! A crate providing secure passphrase generation based on a wordlist also known as
//! [diceware].
//! 
//! [![xkcd-img]][xkcd]
//!
//! The name `chbs` is short for the well known "Correct Horse Battery Staple"
//! password which originates from the [XKCD][xkcd] comic shown above.
//! 
//! This library uses cryptographically secure randomization, and may be used
//! for generating secret passphrases.
//! 
//! Notes:
//! * this crate is still in development, and should thus be used with care
//! * no warranty is provided for the quality of the passwords generated
//!   through this library
//!
//! TODO before stabilization which will require API changes:
//! * use secure strings
//! * allow using custom wordlists
//! * ability to configure various passphrase generation properties:
//!   * random word capitalisation
//!   * add numbers
//!   * add special characters
//!   * different separators
//!   * unique words
//! * calculate entropy
//!
//! ## Examples
//! Here are some basic examples on how to use this crate.
//
//! Generate a passphrase using the helper function consisting of 5 words
//! ([passphrase.rs](examples/passphrase.rs)):
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate chbs;
//! use chbs::passphrase;
//!
//! println!("Passphrase: {:?}", passphrase(5));
//! ```
//!
//! Use a word sampler to generate an infinite number of random words
//! ([sampler.rs](examples/sampler.rs)):
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate chbs;
//! use chbs::word_sampler;
//!
//! let mut sampler = word_sampler();
//!
//! for i in 0..8 {
//!     println!(
//!         "Sampled word #{}: {:?}",
//!         i,
//!         sampler.next().unwrap(),
//!     );
//! }
//! ```
