//! _Note: this crate is still a work in progress, APIs might change until
//! stabilisation_
//!
//! A secure, easy to use, configurable and extendable passphrase generation library
//! based on a wordlist, generally known as [diceware].
//!
//! The crate name `chbs` is short for the well known "correct horse battery staple" password
//! which originates from an [XKCD][xkcd] comic shown in the README [here][xkcd_comic].
//!
//! This library uses cryptographically secure randomization, and may be used
//! for generating secret passphrases.
//! Please refer to the [README][readme] for more information on security.
//!
//! ## Concepts
//! As the passphrase generation system in this crate is thoroughly abstracted it is
//! important to understand how the concepts used in this crate work.
//!
//! Here is what is required for passphrase generation:
//! - A [`Scheme`](scheme::Scheme) defines how a passphrase is generated. Passphrases are only
//!   generated through a scheme.
//! - A [`Scheme`](scheme::Scheme) contains components which represents how the passphrase is built
//!   up and styled. Four kinds of components exist, defining the passphrase generation
//!   steps. For some kinds one must be defined,
//!   for other kinds any number is fine:
//!     1.  [`WordSetProvider`](component::traits::WordSetProvider) (`1` required):
//!         provides a list of words to use in a passphrase.
//!     2.  [`WordStyler`](component::traits::WordStyler) (`>=0` required):
//!         styles passphrase words, for example, to capitalize.
//!     3.  [`PhraseBuilder`](component::traits::PhraseBuilder) (`1` required):
//!         builds a phrase from a set of passphrase words.
//!     4.  [`PhraseStyler`](component::traits::PhraseBuilder) (`>=0` required):
//!         styles a whole passphrase.
//!
//! Things to understand:
//! - Passphrase generation schemes are commonly created by using a configuration
//!   structure. Such as structure will provide various configurable fields, and
//!   builds a corresponding scheme based on it for passphrase generation.
//!
//! The usual steps for generating a passphrase:
//! - A configuration structure is built and configured,
//!   such as [`BasicConfig`](config::BasicConfig).
//! - The configuration struct creates a corresponding passphrase generation scheme.
//! - The scheme is used to generate as many passphrases as needed.
//! - Instead, the [`passphrase()`](passphrase) helper method may be used to generate a passphrase
//!   with zero configuration for ease of use.
//!
//! See, it isn't too difficult, but allows great extensibility. You probably won't
//! use most of what this crate provides.  
//! Take a look at [`BasicConfig`](config::BasicConfig) to see how to configure your first
//! passphrase generator.
//!
//! Additional good-to-know things:
//! - This crate provides a selection of components for specific tasks, custom
//!   components may be built.
//! - This crate provides a [`WordList`](word::WordList) struct to hold a static wordlist,
//!   that may use a built-in wordlist or loads a wordlist from a specified file.
//! - A [`WordSampler`](word::WordSampler) may be [constructed](word::WordList::sampler) based
//!   on a [`WordList`](word::WordList) to allow randomized word sampling in an uniform manner.
//!   Such a sampler is usually what is used as word provider in a configuration struct.
//!
//! ## Examples
//! Here are two very basic examples.
//! First to generate a passphrase with zero configuration using a helper function applying
//! library defaults ([src][example_passphrase]):
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate chbs;
//! use chbs::passphrase;
//!
//! println!("Passphrase: {:?}", passphrase());
//! ```
//!
//! Generating a passphrase with configuration is recommended, here is a basic
//! example ([src][example_passphrase_config]):
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate chbs;
//! use chbs::{config::BasicConfig, prelude::*, probability::Probability};
//!
//! // Build a custom configuration to:
//! let mut config = BasicConfig::default();
//! config.words = 8;
//! config.separator = "-".into();
//! config.capitalize_first = Probability::from(0.33);
//! config.capitalize_words = Probability::half();
//! let mut scheme = config.to_scheme();
//!
//! println!("Passphrase: {:?}", scheme.generate());
//! println!("Entropy: {:?}", scheme.entropy().bits());
//! ```
//!
//! More examples are available in the documentation throughout the crate,
//! and in the [`./examples`][examples] directory.

/// in the [`config`](::config) module such as [`BasicConfig`](config::BasicConfig), which has a
