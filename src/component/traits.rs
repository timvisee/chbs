/// Something that provides random words.

/// A word provider is used to provide any number of words for passphrase generation.
/// Whether random words are genrated, or whether they are sampled from a known wordlist is
/// undefined and decided by the implementor. Providers must be infinite and should never deplete.
/// It is possible that the same word may be obtained more than once.
///
/// When generating a passphrase a set of words is obtained from a word provider by subsequent
/// calls to [`word`](WordProvider::word).
///
/// This trait is not used as component kind on [`Scheme`](::scheme::Scheme), it may however be
/// useful to implement on types that support this functionallity. In addition to that, the
/// [`WordSetProvider`](WordSetProvider) should be easy to implement on types that implement this
/// trait.
