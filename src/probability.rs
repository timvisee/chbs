//! Probability related strucutres
//!
//! This module provides the [`Probability`](Probability) type that is used to define the
//! probability of something being true. This is commonly used in passphrase generation
//! [components](::component) for randomisation of passphrase styling features.  
//! For example, the [`WordCapitalizer`](::component::word::WordCapitalizer) uses this type in it's
//! fields.
//!
//! See [`Probability`](Probability) for more details.
